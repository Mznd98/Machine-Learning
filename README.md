# Machine_Learning
Final project for the exam in Machine Learning in the first semester of my master degree in Data Science, curricula: Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems

The aim of the project was to train the various models we studied in class to the problem of recognising the categories of clothing as represented in a 64x64pixels images. I used the various models, training in cross-validation changing the main hyperparameters, according to what I had learnt in class, and in the end I found that the best model the SVN, which gave me an accuracy over the test set of almost 0.9. The other models still weren't too bad, since they were all giving an accuracy of more than 0.8.
